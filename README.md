# Data-Centric Machine Learning: Developing Models by Developing Data

## Overview

Quantity and quality of training data matters as much to the quality of machine learning models as the choice of architecture, optimizer, and hyperparameters. This workshop will bring together researchers working on methods, theory, and applications for shaping the behavior of models by shaping the data on which those models are trained. This is a rapidly growing area of research, cutting across virtually all areas of machine learning. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Weak supervision by labeling data with rules or related models
- Learning from multiple noisy sources of labels
- Adding explanations to training data
- Curating datasets to shape model behavior
- Encouraging fairness and reducing bias via dataset curation
- Synthetic data generation for machine learning
- Data augmentation
